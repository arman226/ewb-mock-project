        The Birth of EastWest Bank
        <br />
        Established on July 6, 1994, EastWest Bank was the first recipient of a commercial banking license after the central monetary authority liberalized banking in the mid-1990s. Its first branch was opened along Sen. Gil Puyat Avenue in Makati City on August 1, 1994.â€‹
        <br />
        <br />
        Its name is the result of the bank's desire to combine the traditional prudence, warmth and hospitality of the East and the efficiency and progressive-thinking of the West.
